# WAF Tutorial Part 1: Traditional ML 
This repository is the code associated with the WAF manuscript titled: "A Machine Learning Tutorial for Operational Meteorology, Part I: Traditional Machine Learning" written by Chase, R. J., McGovern, A., Burke, A., Harrison, D. and Lackmann, G. under review. If you have any issues with bugs or other questions please leave an 'issue' associated with this repo.

The goal of this manuscript is to familiarize more meteorologists with the tools of ML and accelerate the use of ML in meteorological workflows. In order to accomplish these goals, it is imperative to supply the code and a sandbox for readers to play around with. 


## Getting Started

There are two main ways to interact with the code here. 

1. Use Google Colab 

   * This is likely the quickest way to get started and only requires a (free) google account. Google Colab is a
   cloud instance of python that is run from your favorite web browser (although works best in Chrome). If you wish to use these notebooks, see the directory named colab_notebooks.

2. Install python on your local machine and run notebooks there

   * This is a bit more intense, especially for people who have never install python on their machine. This method does allow you to always have the right packages installed and would enable you to actually download all of the SEVIR dataset if you want it (although it is very big... 924G total).
