    "### Goal: Show some examples of how to interogate a trained ML model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "While alot of this tutorial has been working up to training and evaluating a ML model they can still seem a bit like a black box. In order to help unvail some things that the ML model has learned, we will do a few *explination* methods on the ML here. Specifically, we will show an example of *permuation importance* and the *accumulated local effects*. Both of these methods were discussed in the paper and are already coded up for you in the ```scikit-explain``` python package maintained by Dr. Flora at CIWRO [link](https://github.com/monte-flora/scikit-explain).\n",
    "\n",
    "```scikit-explain``` should already be installed in your environment (installed when you made the environment), but if it isn't use ```pip```\n",
    "\n",
    "```pip install scikit-explain``` \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Load presaved model\n",
    "\n",
    "In notebook 4 and 5, we showed you how to save/load the simple ML model. To save you time we have included the trained models using all features. Let's load them here (for classification)"
